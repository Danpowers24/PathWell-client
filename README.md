Thank you for checking out PathWell! I built this program for a project in my Software Engineering Immersive course at General Assembly.

### Remember the last time you went to the doctor for a chronic pain issue? ###

For many people, the experience goes something like this: You wait for long after the scheduled appoitnment time to see the doctor. Once you are able to be seen by the doctor, you frantically try to recount all of your symptoms as the doctor asks you about your pain. The doctor recommends you keep a diary of your pain and schedules a follow-up appointment. You leave the doctor's office and are just now remembering many other details that you left out.

Now imagine the doctor having all the information about your pain issue before you even get to the doctor's office (or not even having to go to the doctor's office at all!).

### How it works ###

PathWell is a simple way for people with chronic pain to document their pain. Users sign up, log in, and document their pain by the day. Users can add notes to their entries to attach meaningful qualitative data to their easy to measure, quantitative, daily pain level.

### **List of technologies** I used to create this application:
JavaScript\
HTML\
CSS\
AJAX\
jQuery\
Handlebars\
Git\
GitHub\
GitHub Enterprise\
Heroku\
Trello

#### I wanted to make an application that will satisfy the following **user stories**:
V1:
As a user, I would like to sign up with an email and password.\
As a user, I would like to sign in.\
As a user, I would like to log my pain for the day.\
As a user looking to document in more detail, I would like to add a note for each entry.\
As a user, I would like to see all of my logged days.

### Organization tools and **problem solving process**: #

I used Trello to get all my thoughts organized and features planned out. I wanted to plan it all out and give myself instructions for each step. I utilized pseudocode to help convert my plain english/instructions into actual code. I like to collaborate so I worked with classmates through some basic/technical/setup steps.

A good example of one challenge I overcame was when I realized I wasn't running my Rails server for the last two days of the project. I went all of Monday and Tuesday thinking that every single CRUD action was broken until Scott asked me if I was running my server Tuesday night before presentations. I ran the server and everything started working. For two days, I was troubleshooting 404 issues that weren't issues. I felt like I had no time to go back to the basics and learn anything new. I just kept coding and hoping that I was going to get it right. I never even took the time to end my server sessions and power down my laptop for the night - it stayed on running both servers (and later on, only one server) for almost a week straight. I never took the time to take a step back, take a breath, and realize how far I actually got.

### List of **unsolved problems** to be fixed and **other user stories** to be addressed in future iterations: #

As a patient with a diagnosed chronic pain issue in quarantine, I want to be able to supply my doctor with information without having to physically see them.\
As an elderly person with Alzheimerâ€™s, I forget exactly how bad my chronic pain issue is.\
As an athlete with a nagging/chronic injury, I want to track my pain for each practice to analyze the data with my trainer.\
As a person with chronic pain, I want to see how much it actually hurts each day.\
As a patient with chronic pain, I want to be able to track each day and how much pain I have so that I can better inform my doctor about my symptoms.

In future iterations, I want to:\
- add a background image\
- format the 'History' entries into a table\
- add Bootstrap formatting to the website layout and buttons\
- add modals\
- add a nav bar
