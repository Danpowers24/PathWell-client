Thank you for checking out PathWell! I built this program for a project in my Software Engineering Immersive course at General Assembly.

### Did you know that pain is one of the leading reasons Americans are admitted to the emergency room? ###

For many people, the experience goes something like this: You wait for hours in the waiting room before seeing the doctor. Once you are able to see the doctor, you frantically try to recount all of your symptoms as the doctor asks you about your pain. The doctor recommends you keep a diary of your pain and schedules a follow-up appointment. You leave the doctor's office only to remember many other details that you left out.

Now imagine the doctor having all the information about your pain issue before you even get to the doctor's office -- or not even having to go to the doctor's office at all!

## How it works: ##

PathWell is a simple way for patients to document their pain. Users sign up, log in, and document their pain by the day. Users can add notes to their entries to attach meaningful qualitative data to their easy to measure, quantitative, daily pain level.

#### This version of PathWell satisfies the following **user stories**:
V1:
As an unauthenticated user, I would like to sign up with an email and password.\
As an unathenticated user, I would like to sign in.\
As an authenticated user, I would like to log my pain for the day.\
As an authenticated user looking to document an entry in more detail, I would like to add a note for a new entry.\
As an authenticated user, I would like to see all of my logged days.

### Organization tools and **problem solving process**: #

I used Trello to get all my thoughts organized and features planned out and gave myself instructions for each step. I utilized pseudocode to help convert my plain english instructions into actual code. I collaborated with classmates on some basic technical setup steps.

A good example of one challenge I overcame was when I realized I wasn't running my Rails server for the last two days of the project. I went all of Monday and Tuesday thinking that every single CRUD action was broken until Scott asked me if I was running my server Tuesday night before presentations. I ran the server and everything started working. For two days, I was misguidedly troubleshooting 404 issues. I felt like I had no time to go back to the basics and learn anything new. I just kept coding and hoping that I was going to get it right. I never even took the time to end my server sessions and power down my laptop for the night. It stayed on, running both servers (and later on, only one server) for almost a week straight. I never took the time to take a step back, take a breath, and realize how far my project had progressed.

## User stories to be addressed in future iterations: #

As a patient with a diagnosed chronic pain issue in quarantine, I want to be able to supply my doctor with information without having to physically see them.\
As an elderly person, I forget exactly how bad my chronic pain issue is day-to-day.\
As an athlete with a nagging chronic injury, I want to track my pain for each practice to analyze the data with my trainer.\
As a person who is experiencing a new pain, I want to monitor how much it actually hurts each day in case the problem is getting worse.\
As a patient with chronic pain, I want to be able to track my daily pain symptoms so that I can better inform my doctor.

## Features to be added in future iterations: #

- Add a background image
- Format the 'History' entries into a table
- Add Bootstrap formatting to the website layout and buttons
- Add modals
- Add a nav bar
- Let user search for entry by date
- Add diagnostically relevant prompts depending on different types of pain reported (yes no questions, 'have you done something to trigger this pain?', 'Have you experienced this type of pain before?', etc.)
