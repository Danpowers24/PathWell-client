# Welcome! #

Thank you for checking out PathWell! I built this program for a project in my Software Engineering Immersive course at General Assembly.

### Remember the last time you went to the doctor for a chronic pain issue? ###

For many people, the experience goes something like this: You wait for long after the scheduled appoitnment time to see the doctor. Once you are able to be seen by the doctor, you frantically try to recount all of your symptoms as the doctor asks you about your pain. The doctor recommends you keep a diary of your pain and schedules a follow-up appointment. You leave the doctor's office and are just now remembering many other details that you left out.

Now imagine the doctor having all the information about your pain issue before you even get to the doctor's office (or not even having to go to the doctor's office at all!).

PathWell is a simple way for people with chronic pain to document their

#### I wanted to make a game that will satisfy some of the following **user stories**:
V1:
As a user, I would like to sign up with an email and password.\
As a user, I would like to sign in.\
As a user, I would like to log my pain for the day.\
As a user, I would like to add a note for each entry.\
As a user, I would like to see all of my logged days.

Later versions:
As a patient with a diagnosed chronic pain issue in quarantine, I want to be able to supply my doctor with information without having to physically see them.\
As an elderly person with Alzheimerâ€™s, I forget exactly how bad my chronic pain issue is\
as an athlete with a nagging/chronic injury, I want to track my pain for each practice to analyze the data with my trainer\
as a person with chronic pain, I want to see how much it actually hurts each day\
as a patient with chronic pain, I want to be able to track each day and how much pain I have so that I can better inform my doctor about my symptoms

### Organization tools and **problem solving process**: #

I used Trello to get all my thoughts organized and features planned out. I wanted to plan it all out and give myself instructions for each step. I utilized pseudocode to help convert my plain english/instructions into actual code. I like to collaborate so I worked with classmates through some basic/technical/setup steps.

A good example of one challenge I overcame was when
